# Netsoc documentation

_Note: If you'd like to contribute to documentation, please find the repo for the project where the documentation
actually originates from!_

This repo holds documentation pushed in from all of our projects. The site is generated with
[Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) and is available at https://docs.netsoc.ie.

To work on documentation, clone this repo into the same directory as all other Netsoc projects. The Docker Compose file
will set up a server which regenerates documentation on changes.
