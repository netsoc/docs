## netsoc completion

Generate shell completion scripts

### Synopsis

Generate shell completion scripts for Netsoc CLI commands.

The output of this command will be a shell script and is meant to be saved to a
file or immediately evaluated by an interactive shell.

For example, for bash you could add this to your '~/.bash_profile':
	eval "$(bin/github.com/netsoc/cli-linux-amd64 completion bash)"

When installing Netsoc CLI through a package manager, however, it's possible that
no additional shell configuration is necessary to gain completion support.


```
netsoc completion <bash|zsh|fish|powershell> [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -h, --help   help for completion
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
      --config string   config file (default "/home/runner/.netsoc.yaml")
      --debug           print debug messages
```
