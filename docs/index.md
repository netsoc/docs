## Welcome

Welcome to Netsoc's documentation! Here you'll find information about all of
our services and how to use them!

It's a work in progress, so not everything will be documented in detail / at
all! (There isn't much here right now :sob:)

## Contributing

Click the :material-pencil: at the top-right of every page to edit the page
on GitHub.

_Many of our services have their own documentation in a separate repo._ See
[our GitHub page]({{ github_org }}) for a list of repos. Documentation is kept
in a `docs/` subdirectory.
