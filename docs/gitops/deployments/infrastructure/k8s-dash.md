# Kubernetes Dashboard

The official [Kubernetes Dashboard](https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard) provides a convenient user-friendly web UI
for viewing and interacting with cluster workloads. It is accessible at
[k8s-dash.netsoc.tcd.ie](https://k8s-dash.netsoc.tcd.ie).

!!! note
    Because the dashboard is behind basic auth, the dashboard's built-in authentication is disabled and the dashboard
    has broad cluster permissions so that it's possible to interact with the whole cluster.
